            <p>Last updated: October 30, 2024</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Ahoy Indie Media. This Privacy Policy explains how we
                collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you
                use our mobile application. Please read this privacy policy
                carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy
                policy, please do not access the application.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We only collect anonymous IP addresses to analyze traffic to our
                site.
                We do not collect any personal data, and we do not have any
                management accounts.</p>

            <h2>Use of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the anonymous IP addresses solely to understand the amount
                of traffic
                visiting our site. We do not use this information for any other
                purpose.</p>

            <h2>Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We do not sell or share any data collected. All information
                remains anonymous
                and is used only for internal traffic analysis.</p>

            <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures
                to help protect any information we collect. While we have taken
                reasonable steps to secure the information, please be aware that
                no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.</p>

            <h2>Policy for Children</h2>
            <p>We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to
                children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected
                personal information from a child under age 13 without
                verification of parental consent, we will delete that
                information as quickly as possible.</p>

            <h2>Permissions and Sensitive Information</h2>
            <p>Our application does not request permissions to access sensitive
                information on your device. We adhere to the following
                guidelines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We only collect anonymous IP addresses for traffic
                    analysis.</li>
                <li>We do not sell or share any data accessed through these
                    means.</li>
                <li>Users have the right to decline any permission request, and
                    we respect their decision.</li>
                <li>We provide clear explanations for why any data is needed
                    and how it will be used.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

                notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
                this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy
